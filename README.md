Basic Analysis of DNA Sequence Using Python
DNA Sequence Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a given DNA sequence to extract essential insights regarding nucleotide occurrences, GC and AT content, as well as visualizing the distribution of nucleotides. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the composition and characteristics of the DNA sequence, enabling potential implications for genetic research and related fields.

Code Structure
The code comprises various components, including data preprocessing, function definitions for counting nucleotide occurrences, visualization techniques using matplotlib, and basic linear regression modeling. The structured approach emphasizes the use of loops, functions, and visualization methods, facilitating readability and modularity.

Contents
main.py: Contains the main script for executing the DNA sequence analysis.
visualization.py: Includes functions for data visualization using matplotlib.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project and its structure.
Installation
To run the project, ensure that Python 3.x is installed. Additionally, install the necessary packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
